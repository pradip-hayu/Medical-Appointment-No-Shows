Problem Definition and Motivation:

Often patients set up medical appointments and fail to show up to their
appointments. The data suggests that 30% of patients miss their appointments. Using data
on different features of a patient and a regression model, we plan to train a model with a
high degree of confidence in order to isolate the most important variables that impact
whether or not a patient is no-show for an appointment.
Through this project, we aim to aware our audiences regarding the significant
features that determine an appointment show or no show. We are hopeful this will help
decrease the problem of missed appointments.

Objectives:

(1)Data Preprocessing
(2)Exploratory Data Analysis
(3)Machine Learning Models
(4)Hyperparameter Tuning and Model Selection
(5)Comparing different classifiers
(7)Selecting the best classfier
(6)Finding most import variables that affect no-shows
